# LCA-Philippines-Diagnostics
This repository contains the code and figures generated by the Latent-Class Analysis (LCA) discussed in the paper *Reassessing The Use of Microscopy-Based Techniques*, by Vachel Gay V. Paller, Allen Jethro I. Alonte, Billy P. Divina, Frederick T. A. Freeth, Sheina Macy P. Manalo, Joaquin M. Prada, Martha Betson, and Vicente Y. Belizario Jr.

## Data:
The files ```Data_Humans.csv``` and ```Data_Animals.csv``` contain the neccessary data used for the analysis. It contains binary data for the status of a host. In the humans and animals, ```1``` denotes the host being infected with a ```0``` implying undetectable levels of infection.

## Algorithms and Supplementary Figures:
The file ```LatentClassAnalysisFTAF.R``` contains the source code that implements the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and produces the results. It also contains the JAGS models for the humans and animals. It will automatically produce the figures and organise them by host and parasite in separate folders. These figures are not included in the main publication. For each host and parasite:
 - ```<Parasite>_<Host>_Estimated_Probability_of_Infection.svg```: A histogram of how many hosts have a given probability of being infected across the samples.
 - ```<Parasite>_<Host>_Prevalence.svg```: A histogram of the prevalences across all the samples of the JAGS model.
 - ```<Parasite>_<Host>_Sensitivity.svg```: A histogram of the Sensitivties of each diagnostic by parasite.
 - ```<Parasite>_<Host>_Shape_Rate.svg```: A histogran of the shape (```sh```) and rate (```rt```) parameters of the JAGS model.
 - ```<Parasite>_<Host>_Specificity.svg```: A histogram of the specificities of each diagnostic by parasite.


## Main Results and Figures:
- ```Analysis_Human.csv```, ```Analysis_Cats_and_Dogs.csv```, ```Analysis_Pigs.csv```, and ```Analysis_Water_Buffalo_and_Cattle.csv``` contain the diagnostic sensitivity data generated by each diagnostic for each parasite, along with the prevalence data for each parasite generated by the JAGS model for each host.
 - ```Prevalence_Real_Sim_All_Hosts.svg``` is the plot of the simulated prevalence of each parasite compared with the prevalence recorded in the real-world, with error bars highlighting the 95% confidence interval. Each host is arranged in a two-by-two grid with all diagnostics plotted together.
 - ```Sensitivity_Prevalence_All_Hosts.svg``` is the plot of the simulated sensitivites and prevalences of the JAGS model. Each host is arranged in a two-by-two grid, with all diagnostics plotted together.
 - ```Sensitivity_Prevalence_All_Hosts_Simplified.svg``` is the plot of the simulated sensitivites and prevalences of the JAGS model. Unlike the plots in the file ```Sensitivity_Prevalence_All_Hosts.svg```, the scatterpoints are replaced by error bars corresponding to the 95% confidence interval of the data, and the mean of the sensitivity and the mean of the prevalence is plotted point.
 - ```p1_p0_All_Hosts_Simplified.svg``` is the the Reciever Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot of the diagnostic sensitivity and 1 minus the diagnostic specificity. Like ```Sensitivity_Prevalence_All_Hosts_Simplified```, it plots each host for all parasites and diagnostics in a two-by-two grid. The mean of the diagnostic sensitivity and 1 minus the diagnostic specificity are plotted, with error bars corresponding to the 95% confidence interval for the data.

Note: When running the code generating the figures ```Prevalence_Real_Sim_All_Hosts.svg```, ```Sensitivity_Prevalence_All_Hosts.svg```, ```Sensitivity_Prevalence_All_Hosts_Simplified.svg```, and ```p1_p0_All_Hosts_Simplified```, please ensure the RStudio plotting window is very large.
